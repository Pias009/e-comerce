      History
Origin and founder
McLaren Automotive replaced McLaren Cars in 2010. McLaren Cars had been founded in 1985[4] and released the McLaren F1 in 1992. Between 1994 and 2010, McLaren Cars was registered as a 'dormant company', before the founding of McLaren Automotive in 2010. The new company was originally separate from the existing McLaren companies to enable investment in the new venture, but was brought together in July 2017 after Ron Dennis sold his shares in McLaren Automotive and McLaren Group.

McLaren's Formula One founder Bruce McLaren was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1937 of 165 mph and zero to 100 mph time of eight seconds.[9] However, McLaren died in a car accident in 1970 before the prototype could be completed.
